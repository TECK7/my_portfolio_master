# My Perosnal Webpage

## Webpage Design Documentation

### 1. Webpage Building Intent

The core intention of building this personal website is to promote myself to prospective employers. 
The website would contain 5 main sections. These sections are “About Myself”, “Experience”, “Portfolio”, “Future” and “Contact”. 

It is critical to allow interested audience to view my personal webpage on their mobile gadgets. Therefore, the website layout is 
designed around mobile first philosophy. Moreover, it is important to create a webpage that is functional on browsers such as Safari, 
Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer because targeted audience may have different browser installed on their mobile gadgets. 

### 2. Webpage Building Approach

At the start, I had considered three different approaches building my webpage. The first approach is by using free and ready available 
themes from popular websites / blogs. The second approach is to start from scratch by writing completely new HTML 5 and CSS 3 files. 
The third approach is to use popular frameworks such as Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation.  All these approaches have its advantages and disadvantages.

| Approaches       | Advantages                                                          | Disadvantage                                                                                           |
| --- |:---|:---|
| **Free Themes**  | - Desktop / mobile layout is setup properly                         | - Need to understand how the theme is built before adding or modifying features / effects              |
|				   | - Browser compatibility coverage is broad	                         | - Limited flexibility                                                                                  |
|				   | - Modify existing contents easily			                         |                                                                                                        |
| **From Scratch** | - Great flexibility on generating contents / features / effects     | - More time and effort needed to layout responsiveness for both desktop and mobile screens             |
|                  | - Maintain all contents easily                                      | - All areas of browser compatibility need to be tested                                                 |
| **Framework**    | - Tested and reliable                                               | - The files generated for the project may be larger overall due to additional custom css and js files  |
|                  | - Enable developer to focus more on producing contents              |                                                                                                        |
|                  | - Use ready available JS plugin embedded within the framework to add in special features / effects |                                                                         |
