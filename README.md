### 1. Webpage Building Intent

The core intention of building this personal website is to promote myself to prospective employers. 
The website would contain 5 main sections. These sections are “About Myself”, “Experience”, “Portfolio”, “Future” and “Contact”. 

It is critical to allow interested audience to view my personal webpage on their mobile gadgets. Therefore, the website layout is 
designed around mobile first philosophy. Moreover, it is important to create a webpage that is functional on browsers such as Safari, 
Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer because targeted audience may have different browser installed on their mobile gadgets.
